Dear Christian,
Was your travel back OK?
I have already talked with Alfonso and I completely agree with him. You can 
find attached in this e-mail our R-code for performing trimmed k-means 
(kmean.r). I also send you a code for doing clustering of functional data 
(I think that the preprocessing step for transforming curves onto vectors 
is the only difference from previous code).
I can send you also the code for obtaining the trimmed k-variance 
functional. Plese, tell me if you need it.
It was also very nice for me to meet you. I hope to see you soon. Best wishes,
LUIS ANGEL
